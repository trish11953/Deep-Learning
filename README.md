## Welcome to my Deep Learning Repository! This repository is a collection of various deep learning projects and experiments I have worked on during my academic and professional journey. These projects span different domains and applications, showcasing my experience and understanding of various deep learning techniques and frameworks.

Introduction

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on neural networks with multiple layers, allowing models to learn and extract features from large datasets effectively. This repository contains projects that demonstrate my skills in various deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers, and more. The projects cover a range of applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, and generative modeling.

Projects
Here's a list of some of the things the projects cover:

Basics of Neural Networks: Implementing the basics of neural networks from scratch. 

Image Classification: Implementing a convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch and using it for image classification. Using CNNs to classify images from the CIFAR-100 dataset. 

Variational Auto Encoder (VAE): Implemented variational auto-encoder from scratch and tested them on MNIST dataset.

Conditioned Variational Auto Encoder (CVAE): Implemented conditioned variational auto-encoder from scratch and tested them on MNIST dataset.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Creating a GAN to generate realistic images of handwritten digits.

Each project directory contains a detailed README file that explains the project's objective, dataset, techniques used, and results.
